# A method is a grouped collection of Ruby statements that serves a purpose.
# Methods are designed to be reused. Follow the golden rule: DRY.
# Methods abstract the complexity of solving a problem.

# Example: Convert Military Time (1630) to Standard Time (04:30 PM)
# isolate first two numbers
# If first numbers are less than or equal to 12, use them as the hour component and identify period as AM
# Isolate last two numbers. Use them to determine the minutes component of final result.
# Concatenate hour component, a colon, the minutes component, and the period.

# Method Definitions and Calls
# A method is first defined with a set Ruby statements.
# The method es then called or invoked. These are programming terms for "run" or "execute".
