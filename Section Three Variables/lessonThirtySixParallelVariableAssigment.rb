print "In this lesson, we'll learn how we can assign multiple values to multiple variable on the same
line. So it's little bit of a short and it is called parllel variable assigment. So let's say we have
three variables A, B and C, and we want to assign them to the values ten, 20 and thirty respectively\n\n"
print "So kwnowing what we currently knwo, we can write code like this here is variable A being assigned
to the value ten (10), here is the variable B being assidned to the value twenty (20) and then the 
variable C being assigned to value thirty (30)\n\n"
a = 10
b = 20
c = 30
print "And we can output these values to confirm that these variables have been properly assigned, we 
can do the puts method and as a reminder, we can actually use commas to separate multiple entries that
we would like for puts to output for us.\n\n"
print "So we could simply write this as puts A comma, B, comma C, and we are adding a space after the 
comma that is not technically rerequiered, but it makes this easier to read. And all this tells Ruby is
output the values of these three variables and put a line break after each one. So we're going to see
10, 20, and thirty in our terminal\n\n"
puts a, b, c
puts
print "So here is what the shortcut looks like. What we're going to do is still use an equals because
that is the assignment operator. That is what actually designates a value for a nmae like a variable.
But this time around, on the terminal of the equal sign, we're going to declare all of my variables
and separate each one with a comma.\n\n"
print "We're going to do that all on the same line. So if we want three variables A,B and C, we're 
simply going to write them out, just like we did here, separate by a comma. And them we're also going
to add a space just to make it more readable.\n\n"
print "So a then a comma and a space B, then a comma and a space C and this allows me to define three
variables A, B and C, So on the right hand side of the equals sign, we're going to assign the same 
number of values. And for the values, we're similarly going to separate them with a comma.\n\n"
a, b, c =
print "So if we have three variables on the terminal, then we nedd three values on the terminal of the 
equal sign separated by commas. So this time around we're going to do ten (10) comma space, twenty (20)
comma, space trhity (30).\n\n"
a, b, c = 10, 20, 30
puts
print "So as many values as you have right here on the left is how many values you should have right 
here on the right. So three variables being assigned to three values. and the way it's going to work is
sequantially. So because A is first in line, it's going to be assigned to ten, which is the first value
on the right hand side, B is second in line on the left, so it will be assigned to the second vlaue in 
line on the right is twenty (20) and C the third value in line on the left or the third variable in line
to be more precise, will be assigned to the third value on the right, which is thirty (30)\n\n"
print "So now if we output A, B and C, once again we're going to see we get the exact same result.\n\n"
puts a, b, c
puts
print "So this is just a little bit of a shortcut in two lines. We can accomplishe what we did in four
and jsut makes the codde a little bit cleaner. Typically you'll see the syntax these variables are 
directly connected to each other in the sense that they share something in common or are related to the
same construct.\n\n"
print "If they're three totally random variables that have nothing to do with each other, it's probably
a good udea to write them out like this because it kind of better communicates that thyer're separate
and independent.\n\n"
print "Whenever you bundle things up to like this, it's usually to communicate that these things are 
directly related to each other.\n\n"
print "That's all right there is to cover in this lesson. So we'll se you in the next one."
