print "In this lesson, I to show you how we can swap the values of two variables. In other words, if we 
have two variables, how can we take their respective values and flip them around, Reverse them so that
one variables is holding the other variable's value and vice versa? so let we show what we mean.\n\n"
print "What I'm going to do is declare two variables A and B, and I'll just assign them to arbitrary 
values. So here's assign to one and here's B assign to and I'm jsut going to ouput the value of A and
B, and you can see we get one and two. So what I want to do is to swap these variables and the 
respective values.\n\n"
a = 1
b = 2
puts a, b
print "So i want a to equal to two and B to be equal to one. And we can do this all in ten line (in my
code) in Ruby So we're going to utilize the syntax that we wrote in the previous lesson where assigned
multiple variables to multiple values on the same line. As a reminder, we simply separate both the
variables and the values with commas.\n\n"
print "So we're going to stick with A and B here. so we're going to say A comma space B, so that's going
to create or reassign two variables. And now what I want to do is provide their respective values in 
order on the our terminal. And remember, the right hand side is goin to be evaluated first.\n\n"
a, b = b, a # 2, 1
print "So I want a to be equal to two, I need to provide value here that currently represents two at 
this point in the program's execution. And that variable or that value is going to be B, them I'm going
to put a comma and the value A. So you'll notice these sides are the inverse of each other.\n\n"
print "And the reason this is going to work is once again because Ruby evaluates the right side of an
expression first, the right side of an equal sign (=). So if we completely ignore this section and just
think about what B comma A means, it means take the value of B and then follow it up with the value of 
A, So the current value of B when this line runs two, and then the value of a is equal to one.\n\n"
print "So that is what the right side evaluates to. it's the values two and one in order. and we're 
going to assign the variables A and B to these two numbers in sequence. so A becomes two and B becomes
one.\n\n"
puts a, b
print "so after we perform that line, we are going to swap the values of the original variables A and 
B began as one and tw, and after this line, A and B are going to reverse or flip or swap to be two one
So A is equal to two and B is equal to one. And this can be a helpful techinique.\n\n"
print "Sometimes when you have variables and you want to flip their values without needing to create a
third variable to hold an original value, we can basically kind of take their values and invert them or
swap themp in a single line. It's one example of syntax that Ruby offers us that allows us to accomplish
something like this in a very elegant manner. All right\n\n"
print "So once again, we write our variable names ont he left hand side and then an equal sign. And then
we want to write theri assignments or their values on the right hand side and that's going to be 
aveluated first.\n\n"
print "So if we want to reassign And B to their inverse, we simply write B and A, that's going to 
evaluate to their original values and that's what we're going to assign A and B to on this line. It's 
still the exact same variable principles that we're talked about in this section.\n\n"
print "We're still comming up with a name, in this case A and B, through we are assigning to a value, 
we're just being more creative with our use of where are these values taht we are assigning coming from.\n\n"
print "All right, That's all there is to cover in this lesson. So I'll see you in the next one."
