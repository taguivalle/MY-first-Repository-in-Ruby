print "welcom to hte next section of the course. this section is called gettin started and these lessons, we're going to explore the 
fundamental of Ruby, the building blocks that we need to learn to understand more advanced concepts later on in the course. So int htis 
lesson, we want to review the puts method, which we saw briefly earlier in our Hello World example. And as a reminder, we can think of a 
method as a command in Ruby. It is an instruction thet we can ask the language to excuse for us a procedure or a behavior, something the 
language can do for us." 
puts
puts 1
print "So, for example, when we use the puts method and We provide a value like one, the puts method outputs text to the 
screen. and another important detail is that it adds a line break to the end of the output. So outputs is a method to output some bit of 
content and we see that right her on the right hand bellow. So puts is a method thet is avalaible to use within Ruby, but this actual act of 
using it or executing it, writing it our file, the technical term for that, for actually executing the method is called invoking the method 
or alternatively calling the method."
puts
print "So you might hear another Ruby developer say We are invokeing the puts method or We are calling puts methods. That's just the 
technical lingo for execute or run, right? "
puts
print "So that's what we're doing on line one. What are oinvoking a method and We are going to be using those synonyms invoke and call 
interchangeably throughout the course; all right"
puts
print "So we can of course invoke the puts method once, but we can invoke it as many times as we want. so for example, right here, We can
write puts once again and and give it something different, like a mathematical expresion; for example, we can do one plus two and we'll see 
thre appear on the right hand bellow"
puts
puts 1 + 2
puts
print "So once again, puts is going to add a line break to the end of whatever it outputs."
