print "In this lesson, we'll learn about string concatenation. To concatenate two (2) string simply means to
join them together, to glue to one (1) string to the end of anorher. So we're joining two pieces of text,
together and we accomplish that by using the plus (+) sign, wich is kid of fitting because of course, when 
we're dealing with tw (2) numbers like four plus three, the plus (+) sign combines them together and the same 
rules apply for two (2) string. Please see and run the next code in our terminal.\n\n"
puts 4 + 3
print "So right here, we're going to put string race, then a plus (+) sign. And on our terminal, we'll arite 
the string car and Ruby is going to basically add them together to form the new string race car. Please see 
and run the next code in our terminal.\n\n"
puts 41 + 31
puts "race" + "car"
puts
print "So that process of joining two (2) strings together in technical terms is called concatenation, and 
that is a common word across different programming languages. You'll hear the therm string concatenation. All
right. And obviosly, when you look at this example, we might think, well, why would we want to do this? Can't
we just write a single word or a single string consisting of race car? And the answer is, you're absolutely
right.\n\n"
print "There's not really a need to do something like this right now. It's just for the sake of example. But 
here's a real kind of scenario where we might need something lik this. imagine you're writing a program that 
asks a user for their first name and then their last name separately and then you want to display their full
name on screen.\n\n"
print "So you may have one (1) input with the first name and a separate entry or input with their 
second name, their last name. And we need to combine those together and maybe even add a sapce in the middle
so it's readable. So ot's in those kinds of operations where we have dynamic data and we may not be able to 
predict it in advance that things like become really beneficial. So these examples are a little bit contrive\n\n"
print "But the key takeaway is the plus (+) sign what mergers or joins or concatenates two (2) strings 
together. In Ruby. It's important to know that the way that a symbol like the plus (+) sign is going to work 
is going to depend on what data type or object we are working with. So when were working with numbers, of 
course Ruby code is going to simmply add them together.\n\n"
print "But what do we think is going to happen if we do something like this? If we have a string with the 
digit four (4) and we add on the string with the digit three, we're not going to get a string with the digit 
seven. Because these are not numbers that were adding together. As soon as we the double quotes (""), that 
means we're working with a string, we're working with a piece of text. Please see and run the next code in 
our terminal.\n\n"
puts 4 + 3
puts "race " + "car"
puts "4" + "3"
puts
print "And the way that the plus (+) sign works with a piece of text is going to be totally different. So 
lines line thirty five (35) and line thirty seven (37) (in my terminal) are going to give we totally 
different result. This is concatenation because we're working with strings, so we're going to get a new string 
consisting of the characters for three in order, right? This is concatenation because this is text.\n\n"
print "This is addition in the line thirty five (35) because these are numbers. but line thirty-seven are word 
characters or called strings. And that jsut goes show that what objects we're working with matter because the 
operations that we can perm on them are limited depending on what type that objects is.\n\n"
print "So that's an introduction to string concatenation and we will see we in the nexte lesson please."
