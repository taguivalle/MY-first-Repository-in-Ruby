then we will practice the inverse. So if I want to check if the vlaues on the left hand side is

is what it is actually called. So right here, I can say is ten (10) greater than five (5)?\n\n"

answer there is false.\n\n"

guessed it, it is going to be this symbol followed by an equal sign. so I can say is eght (8) greater

at booleans in Ruby. It can be symbols like this in math, it can be the equality operator the 
inequality operator, etcetera. Hoppefully all of this helps clarify exactly what a boolean represents.
And with that, I will see you in the next lesson.\n\n"
