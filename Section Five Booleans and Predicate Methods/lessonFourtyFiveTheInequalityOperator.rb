print "In this lesson I want to introduce the complementary inequality opertor. This operato checks 
two values are not equal to one another, so it is inverive or the opossite of the equality operator.
It will give you a true if the values are not equal to each other and a false if the values are equal
to each other.\n\n"
print "And the symbol for inequality operator is going to be an exclamatin point like so followed by
an equal sign (!=). And I to thing of that exclamation point as kind of blocking or preventin the 
equal sign. And that is how I remember kind of stopping equality, which to me indicates inequality.
in a row. so let me show you an example right here.\n\n"
print "I can say is ten (10) not equal to five (5). So once again, we place the symbol in between
two objects. We add a space around both sides just for readability. And in this case, the inequality
operator will give us true, bacause it is true that ten (10) is not equal to five (5)\n\n"

print "So it is once again the opposite of equality. It will give us a true if two values are in equal 
or unequal. So if I ask Ruby is ten (10) not equal to ten (10), the answer to that is false.\n\n"
puts 10 != 10
puts
print "It is a false statement that ten (10) is not equal to ten bacause it is they are equal values
and the same rules will apply for string comparison. So as a very example, I can ask Ruby is the 
string hello not equal to the string of goodbye? And they are totally different strings.\n\n"
puts "Hello" != "Goodbye"
puts
print "So we are going to get a true. It is true that those strings are nto equal. And similarly, if I
ask Ruby is the string Hello?. With a capital H not equal to the string Hello. With a lowercase h. 
Once again, we are going to get a true.\n\n"
puts "Hello" != "hello"
puts
print "This satatement is true bacause these two objects were their corresponding values are nto equal.
So that it is a true statement. And similarly, if I ask Ruby, is the string hello not equal to the 
string? Hello. With a space at the end that is also a true statement bacause they are different 
strings.\n\n"

print "This one has five characters and this one has six. And finally, when I actually provide two 
equal values to the inequality operator, for example, if I ask Ruby, is the string. Hello? Not equal 
to the string? Hello. That is going to be false because this is a false statement.\n\n"
puts "Hello" != "Hello"
puts
print "It is false or untrue to say that this hello is not equal to this. Hello. Because the are equal.
They are the same value, same string, same number of characters, same capitalization in the same order
Right. So it is false that these two values are not equal to one another, and that is all the 
inequality oparator is. It checks for inequality for two things not being equal to each order. Same 
rules will apply. Of course, I to mention.\n\n"
print "But obviously if we compare different data types the it will give us the expected value. So if
I say is the integer five (5) not equal to a string with the character five (5) the answer is true.\n\n"

print "Those are truly not equal bacause they are not even of the same data type. Right? So operator
this operator returns or gives back to you, the equality operator will always be the opposite or the
inverse. So are complementary. They are fulfill the other side of the respective equation equality 
chaecks for two things being inequality operator checks for two thing being different.\n\n"
